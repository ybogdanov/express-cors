# express-cors
Simple middleware for adding [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) functionality to your [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) app.

### Installation

	npm install express-cors

### Usage
	
```javascript
var cors = require('express-cors')

app.use(cors({
	allowedOrigins: [
		'github.com', 'google.com'
	]
}))
```

	curl -v -H "Origin: https://github.com" http://localhost:3000/

…

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	X-Powered-By: Express
	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://github.com
	Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
	Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With, Content-Type

### Possible hosts specification

* ```https://github.com``` - allow only https scheme for this host
* ```http://github.com``` - allow only http scheme for this host
* ```github.com``` - allow any scheme for this host
* ```*.github.com``` - allow any sub-domain including second-level domain itself
* ```https://*.github.com``` - same as above but restrict for https only
* ```github.com:*``` - allow any port for this host
* ```*.github.com:*``` - allow any port for this host and any sub-domain
* ```https://*.github.com:*``` - same as above but restrict for https only

You've got the idea… If not, see [test.js](https://github.com/0ctave/express-cors/blob/master/test.js) for more examples.

### Other options

* `methods` - array of allowed methods (default value is `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS`)
* `headers` - array of allowed headers (default value is `X-Requested-With, Content-Type`)
* `maxAge` - value for `Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age` header (default is `none`)
